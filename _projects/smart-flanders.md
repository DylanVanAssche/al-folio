title: Smart Flanders
description: Smart Flanders was an <a href="https://summerofcode.be/" target="_blank">Open Summer of Code</a> project in 2018 to convince Flemish cities to publish their data as Linked Open Data. We created a tool for Flemish cities to create Linked Open Data of their buildings and created a <a href="https://w3id.org/smartflanders" target="_blank">blog</a> about it.

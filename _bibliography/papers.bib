  abstract={Publishing real time public transport data can be a heavy task for Open Data publishers (RPC APIs)
and consumers (data dumps). With Linked Connections we try to find a compromise between both
worlds. Since Linked Connections is not optimised for real time data yet, we investigate how the
Linked Connections server can publish real time data in a cost-efficient way. At the same time, we
examine how we can optimise the algorithms to use Linked Connections on the clients.
We propose a list of changes to these algorithms to reduce the processing time and computing
resources. By using a separate real time resource on the Linked Connections server, only the
updates to the data must be transferred. We want to reduce further the necessary resources for the
client and the server for Linked Connections.
We achieve this goal by modifying the Connection Scan Algorithm (CSA) and liveboard algorithms
on the client. We reduced the processing time of a journey with a factor of 2 - 3 using the CSA.
A liveboard could be updated 10 times faster than in the original implementation. The amount of
network bandwidth is reduced by 15 \% for the CSA and by 21 \% for the liveboard algorithm.
Based on these results, we conclude that a publish-subscribe approach (Server-Sent-Events) is
more efficient than a polling approach (HTTP polling) for real time Open Data. Using a real time
resource, the efficiency of the clientâ€™s algorithms is significantly improved.},
